 FuncLibs are list of useful function used to solve PE problems.
Those files are just lists, and not 'directly' included by other
JS codes. Even though some JS solutions are created by Ctrl+C,Ving
these functions, since these functions are quite simple to write,
it's still possible to write all solutions on the Google Chrome
console.
 For example, 066.js uses A LOT OF these functions to manipluate
both quadratic surds and large integers, but it could be written
on the console without look anything.

 There's no license (public domain) for these codes. You may
freely use this codes for any purpose, including solving PE problems.
