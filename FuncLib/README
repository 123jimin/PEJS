 FuncLibs are list of useful function used to solve PE problems.
Those files are just lists, and NOT "included" by other codes.
Even though some JS files contain these functions, since
these functions are quite simple to write, it's still possible
to write all solutions on the Google Chrome console.
 For example, 066.js uses A LOT OF these functions to manipluate
both quadratic surds and large integers, but it could be written
on the console without look anything.

You can use those files when you try to solve a PE problem :)
