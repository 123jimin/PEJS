      PLEASE SOLVE PE PROBLEMS BY CODING YOURSELF, NOT JUST RUNNING THESE CODES!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This is my(123jimin or JiminP) private repository, attempting to solve PE problems
(http://projecteuler.net/problems), with Google Chrome debugging console only.
Which means, all JS codes in this repository can be executed successfully by typing
the source code to the console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) directly.
 
 If you found this repository, then you are probably in one of four categories.


 1. You didn't solve some PE problems, and want to know the answer.

   - If you just want the answer to increase 'Solved' stats, then remind this sentence
     from the PE website:
 
      "If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you achieved?"


   - If you want what ideas I used to solve the puzzle, these codes may not help you
     a lot. Because, since I wrote most of these on the console, most of codes are
     quite hard to read, and there's no explanation about codes.


 2. You solved PE problems what these codes provide answers, and are curious how
    problems can be solved using JS only.

   - Well, then feel free to read my codes. However, I have no responsibility
     if your brain is exploded because of my dirty, dirty codes.


 3. You think this repository is not OK and should be removed, because you are
    uploading answers of PE to the internet.

   - If this README file and the name of the only folder on here is not enough, then
     notice your opinion to me. I will delete this repository if more than two people
     hate this.


 4. You are just a random guy.

   - Hello!
