 This is my(123jimin or JiminP) private repository, attempting to solve PE problems
(http://projecteuler.net/problems), with Google Chrome debugging console only.
Which means, all JS codes in this repository can be executed successfully by typing
the source code to the console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) directly.

 These codes are...

  * Most codes are shortened very much (no comments, names of variables are shortened, abused
  for loops and '?:'s, ...), so they are hard to read.
  * Except few exceptions like 052.js, almost all codes actually calculate codes.
  * Some of them includes HUGE text data, like 062.js. I used gedit to automatically convert
  raw text datas to usable datas. Just change several times something like '\n to "],\n["'.
  * All source codes are written by me, unless other things are mentioned in the source code.
  * Almost all codes run under a minute on Google Chrome 14 on my laptop using 3.7GB RAM and
  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU (2.40GHz*4). One of exceptions is 050.js, which takes roughly 90s.
 
 If you found this repository, then you are probably in one of four categories.
I made this repository because of second kinds of people.


 1. You didn't solve some PE problems, and want to know the answer.

   - If you just want the answer to increase 'Solved' stats, then remind this sentence
     from the PE website:
 
      "If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you achieved?"


   - If you want what ideas I used to solve the puzzle, these codes may not help you
     a lot. Because, since I wrote most of these on the console, most of codes are
     quite hard to read, and there's no explanation about codes.


 2. You solved PE problems what these codes provide answers, and are curious how
    problems can be solved using JS only.

   - Well, then feel free to read my codes. However, I have no responsibility
     if your brain is exploded because of my dirty, dirty codes.


 3. You think this repository is not OK and should be removed, because I am
    uploading answers of PE to the internet.

   - If this README file and the name of the only folder on here is not enough, then
     notice your opinion to me. I will delete this repository if more than two people
     hate this.


 4. You are just a random guy.

   - Hello!
